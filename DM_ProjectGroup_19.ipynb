        "The Zambina leggal system produces different types of legislative documents, such as Bills, Acts, and Statutory Instruments (SIs). These documents are essential for governance, law enforcement, and civic education. However, due to the large volume of documents and their textual similarities, it is difficult for the general public and researchers to quickly identify and categorize them.\n",

        "Manually classifying these documents is time-consuming and prone to errors. Therefore, applying data mining and machine learning techniques to automatically classify legislation can improve efficiency, accessibility, and public engagement with legal information."
